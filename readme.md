## About Myself

As an ambitious and motivated computer science student, I am excited to embark on my journey as a professional in the tech field. Having resuming my 2nd year of studies, I am now actively seeking internship positions that will allow me to apply and further develop my skills in a real-world setting.

One of my key motivations is to actively contribute to open-source projects as a means of building my network and learning from experienced developers. I am dedicated to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in the industry. I also plan to leverage platforms like GitHub to actively contribute to open-source projects and expand my network within the developer community.
